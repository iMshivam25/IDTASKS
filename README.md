Projects Detail

1. Password Generator
This project generates a random password for the user. The user can choose the length of
the password and the types of characters to be included (such as uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters).

3. URL Shortener
This project creates a tool that shortens long URLs into shorter ones that are easier to
share. The program generates a unique short URL for each long URL and redirects the user
to the original URL when they enter the short URL.

4. YouTube Video Downloader
This project allows the user to download YouTube videos by providing the video's URL. The
program uses the YouTube Data API to retrieve information about the video, including its
title and download URL. It then downloads the video and saves it to the user's local
machine.
